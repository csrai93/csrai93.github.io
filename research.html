    <h2>Research Philosophy</h2>
    <!-- Content about your research philosophy -->
    <p>The idea of research for me is twofold - 1) It should be 'to introduce' rather than 'to produce'. 2) The outcome of research should be publication, not the other way round. I enjoy being involved in joint and open discussions with my fellow researchers and students on different technologies related to my field of interest, which ultimately leads to algorithm development. </p>

    <h2>Prospective areas of research</h2>
    <!-- Content for prospective scholars -->
<!--     <p>If you are looking to pursue MS or PhD, I feel there are some important things that you should consider. In order to pursue research, it is important that you set your expectations right. This is not a coursework program where a degree is guaranteed after attaining certain credits. Before enrolling to any research oriented program, be clear of what is expected of you both from your supervisor as well as university requirements, if any. As supervisors, our responsibility is to support you to the best of our ability in this regard.</p> -->
<!--     <p>If you are thinking of working with me, you are always welcome to contact me and start a conversation regarding your aspirations and plans. Since these are long term commitments, it is better to get to know each other. It would also benefit you to know someone you are choosing to work with.</p> -->
<!--     <p>Wish you my best!</p> -->
    <p>I am actively working on the radar systems currently. Specifically, I work on the target detection and parameter estimation with a smaller number of measurements. I am also working actively on drone detection and micro-motion parameter estimation. As a future interest, I am looking to work on the radar for healthcare systems.</p>
     <p> During my PhD, I investigated the spatial wideband effects on the uniform linear antenna array based systems and applied Machine-Learning and Deep Learning tools mixed with classical array signal processing techniques for robust signature estimation of spatial wideband systems. As a continuation of this field, I am looking forward to working on near-field effects in communication and radar systems. <p> -->

    <h2> Prospects on Joining me </h2>
    <p> I am actively working with my collaborators at IITD, IITKGP, and IITI. Thus, with me, you get an opportunity to pursue cutting-edge research with some of the top universities in India.</p>
